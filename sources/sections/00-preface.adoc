== Introduction

The industries dedicated to the architecture, engineering, construction and operation of infrastructure assets (AECO) have been adopting state of the art advancements in information technologies, including building information modeling (BIM), internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). These efforts have been leading these industries to embrace Digital Twin (DT) applications and processes in order to enhance Business Intelligence, Decision Support and Situational Awareness. The concretion of these developments heavily rely on the overall quality, alignment and discoverability of data in a DT. Semantical standardization of data is an important part of those requirements, which enables outcomes such as automated validation, interoperability and simulations. This discussion paper focuses on a piece of information that is common to most of those goals: semantical machine-understanding of materials captured in a DT for AECO.

This paper presents a brief overview of the state of the modeling of materials in a sample of existing standards - IFC, CityGML and 3D Tiles - and software vendor applications - Base Infrastructure Schemas (BIS), an Open Source effort by Bentley Systems, and the Granta product-line by ANSYS - relevant for AECO industries. This is done in light of the needs for machine-understanding of materials in a DT for AECO.
